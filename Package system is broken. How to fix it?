After you get that error, try sudo apt-get -f install to force an install of the files that didn't get loaded because of the error.

Then try sudo apt-get update again, sudo apt-get -f install back and forth until only the package that has the error is left.

sudo dpkg --configure -a

and clean the cache

sudo apt-get clean
