Prereq:

apt-get install zsh
apt-get install git-core

Getting zsh to work in ubuntu is weird, since sh does not understand the source command. So, you do this to install zsh

wget https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/raw/master/tools/install.sh -O - | zsh

and then you change your shell to zsh

chsh -s `which zsh`

and then restart


for all users to be implemented.. change the ownership of the .zhrsc, .zsh related files and .oh_my_zsh files and also provide the respective path to the 
oh_my_zsh folder in the .zhrsc file
